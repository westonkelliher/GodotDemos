# TheClaw

This demo requires a controller. You move a mechanical arm that takes some 
skill to control adeptly.

### Controls
- Right bumper to grab
- Left stick to control the base of the arm
- Left trigger to increase the pivot depth of the base arm
- Right stick to control the outer joint of the arm
- Right trigger to increase the pivot depth of the outer arm


### The Idea
I like the idea of using this mechanic in a defense game where you have to 
throw rocks and other projectiles at oncoming enemies. If the base of the arm
is attached to a moveable base instead of fixed in place, you could use it for 
a "Getting Over It" style platformer.

### Fun Fact
I ran out of time to fix the physics on the boxes, so they're buggy but you can 
just imagine they have normal physics on them.
