# Fishing

Your goal here is to keep the fish within bounds until the left side bar fills up.

### Controls
- Click to make your box go up, hold to make it go up faster
- Click to the left or right of the screen to pull your box left or right


### The Idea
This mechanic is something I would use in a mobile game where you catch 
different varieties of fish, upgrade your fishing rod, and unlock new areas.


### Fun Fact
This idea was inspired by Luke's fishing mechanic for the GameNite game jam 
which was based on Stardew Valley's fishing mechanic.
