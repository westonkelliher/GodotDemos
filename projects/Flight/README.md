# Flight

Fly around as a bird. Try to get high in the air, build up speed, and do aerial 
stunts in glide mode.
**If you are having trouble gaining height, flap faster and fuller**

### Controls
- Hold spacebar to flap and release spacebar to un-flap
- w and s to pitch your wings forward and backwards
- a and d to roll the tips of your wings
  - this will affect yaw when flapping and roll when gliding
- Click and drag the mouse for glide controls
  - up-down drag pitches the whole body
  - left-right drag controls yaw
- Press u to be teleported high into the air

### The Idea
This mechanic could be used in a game that is similar in spirit to games like 
"Getting Over It", where the play must use unintuitive controls to navigate 
difficult obstacles.
The mechanic could be used in a competitive, high-skill-curve game in a 
Rocket League style. Perhaps it would look similar to quidditch.

### Fun Fact
One tester was able to land on top of one of the tall, thin pillars.
