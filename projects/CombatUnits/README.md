# CombatUnits
Spawn little units and watch them fight. 


### Controls
- 1 to spawn a small red unit at the mouse position
- 2 to spawn a medium green unit at the mouse position
- 3 to spawn a large blue unit at the mouse position

### The Idea
Each unit has a left hand and right hand attack which are both punches by 
default. Every other unit has an axe which does more damage and has better 
range but does less knockback. This would be used in a strategy or 4X game 
where the units and their gear are produced separately and part of the strategy 
would be in how you choose to equip your units.
