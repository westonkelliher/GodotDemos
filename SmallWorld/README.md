# SmallWorld

Run and jump around. Try to go into orbit or land on an asteroid.

### Controls
- Arrow keys to move
- Spacebar to jump. You can keep jumping in the air.


### The Idea
This setup could be used for a platformer where the terrain includes highly 
localized gravity fields. I think it would be cool in a survival game though. 
Progressing would unlock new movement options that allow you to reach further 
little planets with different resources.
