# Grubs

There is no goal here. This is simply a controller for a non-player unit that 
is procedurally animated that is unique in movement to what is commonly seen in 
games. Experiment with making the critter go forward and backwards.

### Controls
- Move your mouse around the environment to make critters follow it


### The Idea
This mechanic would be used in an RTS, 4X, or management-survival game. These 
would likely be the peon units, able to pick up resources with their grabber 
end.
