# RingChemistry

Put down orbs and pop them to affect other orbs. Your goal is to make a yellow 
triangle and see what it does.


### Controls
- click on an empty space to spawn a blue orb
- click on an element to pop it

### The Idea
I want to use this mechanic as a simple form of chemistry where you start with 
basic elements and create more complex elements. You have resource constraints 
but different elements provide different benefits and you can come up with more 
efficient chains of reactions to produce more of a given elements with less 
reagents.
