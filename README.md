# GodotDemos

In this repo there are 8 different demos for you to check out in the 
CheckItOut directory. If you are in Windows, open the CheckItOut folder and 
run `play_all.bat`. If you are in Linux, run `./CheckItOut/linux/play_all.sh`. 

Each demo was built in about 5 hours. They are not full games, rather, each one 
is single mechanic or feature that could be part of a game.

## Your Task
Your task is to go check out each demo then pick your favorite three. You should 
judge based on whether you would want to see the given feature in an actual 
game. Because these demos are pretty incomplete projects, the demos include a 
description of the idea behind the demo and how it might be implemented in a 
full game.

Once you've tried each demo, open up `top_picks.txt` and indicate which 
three you choose. For the three you choose also indicate whether you liked the 
actual implementation or you just liked the idea. (You may also indicate a 
weight for your choices as shown in the example below if you'd like.) Then take 
a screenshot or copy-paste your top picks and send em over to Weston.


Example top_picks.txt:

```
CombatUnits: 
Fishing: idea 2
Flight: 
Grubs: idea 4
HandLines: implementation 3
RingChemistry: 
SmallWorld:
TheClaw: idea 3
```

If you choose to add weights to your choices, indicate a demo you liked more 
with a higher number. (Your weights will be normalized so don't worry about 
using large numbers or small numbers. If you liked A twice as much as B, give 
A a weight twice as large as B.)

If something is unclear or doesn't work, let me know. If you have any thoughts or 
comments, please include that as well. Thanks!
