# Renderer

There is nothing to do in this demo and it is not a game mechanic but rather a 
method of producing art. It takes a 3d object and produces a spritesheet to 
represent the object and its animations in 2d at many different angles.

The project is unfinished.

### Controls
- none

### The Idea
This renderer would likely be vastly improved by rendering with a more 
interesating shader e.g. one that creates a black border to make sprites more 
distinct.
It could be used as a starting point for pixel art where the art is improved by 
hand or machine learning.

### Fun Fact
The games Factorio and Dead Cells use a strategy like this for their art.
